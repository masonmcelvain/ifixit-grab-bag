# iFixit Grab Bag
## About this app
This app lets users create a collection of devices that they own so that they can easily find repair guides and other information for their devices on [iFixit's website](https://www.ifixit.com).
<br/><br/>
The app uses [iFixit's API](https://www.ifixit.com/api/2.0/doc) to help users select the devices they own that are supported by iFixit. Users can drag and drop items into their bag, and their bag is persistent across page reloads.
